# API-URL-Catcher
Prototype Chrome extension using xAPI to capture URL activity patterns for learning insights.

I'm building this Chrome extension to explore how xAPI can capture browsing patterns for learning design purposes.  
This project is part of my personal research into AI and workplace training needs, in collaboration with a developer.

## Purpose

To reduce irrelevant training content and identify learning gaps based on actual employee needs.

## Status

MVP is functional but currently experiencing performance issues (freezing, blocking the bookmark bar). Debugging in progress.
Styling and learning content are in progress.

## Ethical Note

This project uses only my own data as part of a personal xAPI project. Itâ€™s not designed for surveillance or monitoring others.
